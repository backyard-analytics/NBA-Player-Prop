# NBA Player Prop

## Getting Started

These scripts are design to work with the game logs from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
You can export the games logs by selecting a player and clicking on the "Game Logs" link.

You want to export the data as "Get as Excel Workbook". This will download you an excel version of the data table. 
Save the file as a CSV file. Best practice is to name it the player. For example, "LeBron_James.csv".

## Adding a Player

If you are using the script in your IDE, simply read the file and the script will it remove the rows that the player missed.

If you are running the app within your browser, simply upload the csv version file and the script will it remove the rows that the player missed.
